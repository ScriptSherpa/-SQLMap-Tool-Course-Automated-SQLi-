## üß™ Mini Projects Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Description**: Demonstrates a stored XSS vulnerability by injecting a malicious comment on a blog that triggers an alert when viewed.
- **Objective**: Understand how persistent XSS works and how it can affect website users.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Injection Attack
- **Description**: Simulates an SQL injection vulnerability in a product search or login page to leak all product information.
- **Objective**: Learn how attackers exploit input fields to manipulate SQL queries.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Access Control Vulnerability
- **Description**: Explores a misconfigured admin panel accessible via a hidden URL, found by analyzing the app structure.
- **Tool**: Uses [PortSwigger Labs](https://portswigger.net).
- **Objective**: Identify flaws in access control and improper URL protections.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ HTTP vs HTTPS Demonstration
- **Description**: Develops an insecure HTTP website and demonstrates how attackers can tamper with it. Then implements HTTPS with SSL to secure it.
- **Objective**: Highlight the importance of encryption in web traffic and payments.
